Hi

Here is a free realistic terrain sample! It can be tiled to create more big world! (flighsim?)
The textures are provided to 4K and the terrains RAW 16 datas are provided to 2K. 

Diffuse textures are not color/editable, but you can add your own, with another splatting layer
to draw roads or anything you want :)

I hope you like it!
